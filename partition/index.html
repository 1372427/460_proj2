            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The partition chart is similar to a tree chart in that it shows hierarchial data. Like a tree 
          chart, the partition chart parents items by placing them under (or to the right, if the partition chart
          is being made horizontally) items higher in the hierarchy. Differences between the partition chart and 
          tree chart is that a partition chart doesn't necessarily show the root node, and that value is also encoded 
          into the chart. While a tree chart only represents items as uniform nodes, the partition chart takes into account 
          the value of the nodes and determines their size from this information.</p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include lines. As the lines are of uniform value in one variable (height if the partition chart is being 
          made vertically), the only important aspect of the line is one variable (width if the partition chart is vertical). Therefore, 
          the mark is a line and not an area.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the length or width of the lines (depending on how the chart is being made), as well as 
          color for denoting different categories, and spatial placement to show the hierarchial information.</p>
