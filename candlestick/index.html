            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p> The candlestick chart originated with the Japanese. 
                It was invented by farmers to keep track of the market 
                value of merchandise such as rice. It currently is used 
                in the same capacity -showing the price of stocks and 
                other such items. Each candlestick has an opening, closing, 
                high, and low value. There is one candlestick per time interval. 
                With the one candlestick, you are able to see what the price 
                of the item started out at, what it ended at and what the 
                peak high and low values were. Often, the candlestick is 
                colored based on whether the closing price was higher or 
                lower than the opening price. This helps people see at a glance 
                the main information, as well as give them the opportunity to look 
                at the details. While this is a highly effective graph for showing
                 information such as you would get from market values, it does 
                 not expand well to other types of information. </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include two sets of lines. The first line shows the high and low values. The 
                second line shows the opening and closing values. In both cases, the width of the line 
                is irrelevant as it is not changed by the data; therefore, the mark is the line and not the 
                area.
            </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the position of the lines on a common scale. There is the vertical point 
                for the line based on the opening value, the vertical point for the line based on the low
                value, the vertical point for the ending of the line based on closing value, and the vertical
                point for the line based on the high value. Another channel may be the color of the lines. Often, 
                this channel is used to identify whether the item's opening value was higher or lower than the closing
                value.
