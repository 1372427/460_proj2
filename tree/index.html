            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The tree graph shows hierarchial information. It is similar to a cluster graph in that it uses 
          nodes to represent items and line as links to connect the nodes. The tree is usually made so that 
          nodes higher in the hierarchy are placed higher on the tree. The difference between the tree and cluster
          graphs is that with the tree graph, the placement in the hierarchy matters. The placements of nodes are 
          dependant on its depth in the tree. This is in contrast to the cluster graph, which places leaf nodes (nodes 
          without any children or items below them) at the bottom of the graph. Imagine charting the organization of a 
          business where each node was an employee. The important information to keep is the level each employee is at. 
          All division managers should be on one level, for example. In the tree graph, this level, or depth in the hierarchy is what
          is important.</p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include points (basic shapes, usually a circle), and lines used as links for connections.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include spatial placement of the points, and potentially color if used to categorize items.</p>
