            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The donut chart is similar to the pie chart. The only difference in how values are displayed
              is that donut charts have a hole in the center whereas pie charts are a full circle. When using
              a donut chart, the viewer must compare the size of the slices not by the angle seen in the center, 
              but by the apparent length of the arc visible to them. This may be easier to do in some cases, especially
              with more values being displayed. The same issues of it being difficult to label and view minute differences 
              are present when using the donut chart.

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area as well as the color of the slice, which is often used to denote the 
              category.
