            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The stacked area chart is similar to the area chart in that it is defined by a line and 
              the area below it is colored. The difference is that in the stacked area chart, several 
              areas are shown. They are usually depicted in different colors, and the area is representative
              of the value. This kind of graph is useful for cummulative sets of data. For example, a good 
              use of this kind of graph would be to have the amount of hours spent each week for development,
              debug, and testing. This would show if more time has been spent on debugs over time as compared to 
              development, showing that perhaps something may need to change. This kind of graph may not be as 
              effective if dealing with many different categories as it may become more difficult to tell the small 
              differences between areas.

            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include area </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area as well as the color of the area, which is  used to denote the 
              category.
