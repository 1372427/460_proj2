            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The choropleth is used when information is dependant on geographical location. 
                Often information is based on the color a particular area is filled in with. 
                This kind of graph is helpful when trying to determine trends based on location, 
                or see hotspots grouped around a particular area. These kinds of graphs are 
                often used when displaying information such as political stance. While this 
                type of graph can be helpful to see the overall trend in locations such as states, 
                it may obscure other information. One must be careful about things such as skewed 
                representation if the target of the information is population rather than landmass. 
                Having information being grouped by area and then averaged also gets rid of more of 
                the details, which is why a map with overlays might be also be a better consideration.  </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include the area bounded by location information. Depending on the type of graph, the 
          area itself is irrelevant and what is important is the area being contained. Because of this, the 
          mark could also be a grouping mark of containment.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the color which each area is colored.</p>
