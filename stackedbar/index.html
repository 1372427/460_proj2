            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The stacked bar graph is similar to the bar graph, except the bars consist of multiple
              categories stacked on top of each other. This can be helpful for showing multiple categories relating
              to the same time. For example, if one were trying to look at their expenses, they could use a bar Chart
              and show the money spent per week over several weeks. However, if they were trying to cut down on expenses, 
              they might want more detailed information. They could then split each bar show it showed the amount of money 
              spent on food, transportation, utilities, pleasure, or other categories of their choosing. This would allow them
              to see both the bigger trend of how much overall money was spent, while also helping to show smaller trends, like 
              whether one category increased or decreased over time. This stacked bar graph is helpful as it can condense what would
              otherwise be several bar graphs into one. However, it may be hard to see relative values as after the first category, 
              as the individual categories are on unaligned axises.
