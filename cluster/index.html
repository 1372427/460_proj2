            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>Cluster graphs are similar to tree graphs in that they show the hierarchical 
                information between items, or nodes. The difference is the focus on what 
                information is important. Cluster maps have the nodes forced to the bottom. 
                This causes the viewer to focus on the end results. Cluster graphs are also 
              known as dendrograms and are mostly used to determine how to cluster items together. 
              To do this, the height of the nodes in a dendrogram is what is important. One must
              be careful, though, as the dendrogram does not help tell how many clusters the 
              data should be split into.
              A common use of a dendrogram is for tournaments. </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include basic shapes (usually points) for the nodes, and lines to connect the nodes.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include spatial region and possibly color to identify different types of nodes.</p>
