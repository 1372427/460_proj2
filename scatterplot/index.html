            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The scatterplot can be used to show relations based on two variables. Typically, both the 
              x-axis and y-axis represent numeric variables. This type of graph is often used in the natural
              sciences to show trends. For example, the volume and mass of an object can be recorded for different
              samples. If the volume is on one axis, and the mass is on the other, a linear correlation can be seen.
              The scatterplot is similar to the line chart in that it is helpful for discovering such trends. However,
              the scatterplot can be used for larger sets of data, or is helpful when it is not certain whether there is 
              a trend or not.

            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include the points. 
            </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the horizontal and vertical position of the point. If desired,
              the points can also be given a color or size denoting another channel. Color can be 
              used to group the points by category, while size can be used for another numeric variable.
