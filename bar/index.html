            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The bar graph can be used to display simple information. Usually, this graph
              is used when comparing some numeric value between groups. For example, a bar graph
              can be used to show the amount of sleep a person got on a given day of the week. In this case,
              the y-axis would represent the number of hours slept, and the x-axis would represent the day. 
              Similarly, the bar graph can be used to show the amount of sleep different people got on the same
              day. In this case, the x-axis would be the person. While some trends can be seen with this graph,
              if looking for a way to show change over time, line graphs or scatter plots may be preferrable. 
              The bar graph is best used when trying to compare values for one variable between defined groups.

            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include the bars themselves. The mark is a line as the width of the 
              bars is irrelevant, and the variables are only being mapped to the length of the 
              bar. 
            </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the length of the bar. Color could also be included as an additional
              channel, but in this case it is not.
