            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p> A packed circle graph is similar to a tree map in that it shows hierarchical data.
                 Compared to other hierarchical graphs, the packed circle chart uses circles to 
                 represent the item, or node. Child nodes are linked to their parent nodes by being 
                 placed inside of them. One thing to consider with this graph is how to label items and
                the importance of labels. </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area as well as color. </p>
