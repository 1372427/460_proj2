            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p> A packed circle graph is similar to a tree map in that it shows hierarchical data.
                 Compared to other hierarchical graphs, the packed circle chart uses circles to 
                 represent the item, or node. Child nodes are linked to their parent nodes by being 
                 placed inside of them. One thing to consider with this graph is how to label items and
                the importance of labels. This kind of graph is helpful if the focus is the children. It 
            is more difficult to get informaation on the parent nodes or intermediate nodes with this graph.</p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include area which also acts as a containment node.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area as well as color. The spatial placement
                is also shown in terms of which circles are inside others.
