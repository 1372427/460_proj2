            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>Maps are similar to the choropleth in that they show information 
                based on geographical location. Maps can have a variety of 
                overlays, including points for case information, zooming and panning 
                capabilities. If one needs to show complex information which benefits 
                from geographical representation, using a map with these different 
                layers may be a good way to prevent any information from being lost. 
                A great example is Google Maps. Different information is shown when zooming in or out.

            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include area or containment of the geographical information, as well as
          potentially points or lines as links for other information placed as overlays to the underlying
          choropleth.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include color which is used to categorize different elements, as well as spatial 
          region, placement on a common scale, area, length, or others depending on the type of information
          being displayed for the overlays.</p>
