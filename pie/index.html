            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The pie chart is similar to the donut chart. The only difference in how values are displayed
              is that donut charts have a hole in the center whereas pie charts are a full circle. When using
              a pie chart, the viewer must compare the size of the slices or the angle seen in the center. It
              may be difficult to label pie slices and view minute differences if there are multiple categories. 
              Pie charts are more effective for displaying a single variable for a small number of categories. 
              Charts displaying, Yes/No answers are very effective, for example. One must also be careful not to
              skew results by using 3D perspective on pie charts. This may make it even more difficult to view 
              the difference in size of the slices.

            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area as well as the color of the slice, which is often used to denote the 
              category.
