            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>A tree map shows hierarchical information. Similar to a packed circle graph, 
                the treemap shows child elements as being inside their parent elements. 
                However, a treemap uses rectangles rather than circles and therefore might be more organized 
                in terms of being able to read the groups quickly. Using padding for the treemap also allows 
                for better labelling. While the packed circle is useful for focusing on leafs and as such may only 
                have leafs labelled, the treemap likely has all levels labelled as in the above example.
