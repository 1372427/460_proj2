            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The chord graph is used to represent flow between various groups. 
                Each individual chord has a start and ending point. The width of these 
                points as determined by the angle of the chord corresponds to value. This kind of graph is useful when trying 
                to show the relationship between groups. An example might be the number 
                of people migrating between countries. A chord graph is useful as it 
                conserves space and the width of the chords is a pretty simple channel to register.  </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include connection links. The chords link two items together.</p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include angle as well as color. The size of the angle shows the 
                value being added or removed from the item. The color is usually used as a way of 
                categorizing items.
