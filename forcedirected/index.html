            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p> Force directed graphs are a way to display network data, 
                or relationships between items. Each item, or node, is represented
                 as a circle or other basic shape. Relationships between 
                 items are shown as lines, or links, connecting these nodes.
                  The force directed graph calculates the position of the nodes 
                  based on the position of other nodes it is connected to. This 
                  helps the user be able to interact with the graph and investigate 
                  more closely what the relationships between the nodes are. This 
                  kind of graph is helpful for identifying clusters of connected nodes.
                   A common example is to graph the friends in person or online of one individual. 
                   This would show if there are any groups of friends who know each other, 
                   such as people from work compared to people from a hometown or family. The kind 
                   of data this graph is useful for is limited, but if the goal is to
                    explore the relationships of items, this would be a helpful graph. </p>
            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include points (basic shapes, usually circles) for the nodes and lines as links which 
          connect the nodes. </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the spatial placement of the nodes, as well as color if being  used to categorize
          the nodes.</p>
