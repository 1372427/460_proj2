            <h1>About this Graph</h1>
            <p>The area chart is similar to the line chart. The difference is the bottom half of the 
              chart as specified by the line is colored in. This can be useful if the variable is a kind
              of cummulation rather than a single point value. This graph does not show details about the area 
              and what components it is made of. If this is important, then the stacked area chart should be 
              considered. An example of what information this graph should be used for is to map the grades 
              of a test by a class of students.

            <h2>Marks and Channels</h2>
            <h3>Marks</h3>
            <p>Marks include area. </p>
            <h3>Channels</h3>
            <p>Channels include the size of the area. Color can also be used to show a threshold value or 
              some other information which may separate the same area. This would lead it to be closer to a stacked
              area chart.
